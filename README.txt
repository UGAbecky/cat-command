How to Compile:
    Use the command:
    $make compile

    this command will pass -Wall -pedantic-errors to the gcc



How to Run:

    Use the command:

    $./cat [file_name]


    to run the program. The .txt program in the project directory 'input.txt' is a test scenario
    that can be used with the program, but optional.



How to clean:

    Use the command:



    $make clean

    to clean the program, this will delete the executable file cat after running the program.
